Conway's Game of Life
=====================
Python implementation of Conway's game of life, made to spend a few hours while I was bored.

According Wikipedia, these are the rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
